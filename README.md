# NextAuth.js Session Undefined in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a bug in a Next.js 15 application using NextAuth.js where the session is sometimes undefined in `getServerSideProps`. This leads to intermittent failures in loading the About page.

## Bug Description

The `About` page uses `getServerSideProps` to retrieve the user session from NextAuth.js. However, under certain conditions, the session data is undefined resulting in an error when trying to access `session.user.email`.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.  The page may sometimes load successfully, and sometimes fail to display the session details.

## Solution

The solution involves more robust error handling and potential adjustments to how the session is fetched, which is detailed in the provided code.
